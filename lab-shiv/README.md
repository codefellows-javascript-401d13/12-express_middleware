## Description
  * Create a single resource `express` API that can handle **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** requests
  * Use the `http-errors` module to create new errors and associate them with a proper status code
  * Create an `error-middleware` module to handle errors and *use* it in your server file
  * Create a `cors-middleware` module that will allow for public use of your API
  * Create the `deleteItem` and `availIDs` methods and add them to your `storage` module
    * these methods should be used to delete a resource (`deleteItem`) and return an array of id's from persisted resource filenames (`availIDs`)
  * Create the `updateLeader`, `fetchLeader`, and `fetchIDs` static methods as part of your `leader` model
  * Create a series of `leader-route-tests` to test your **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** routes
    * **hint:** *you'll want to use the `before` and `after` hooks provided by `mocha` in order to create a test leader and delete the leader after the test has completed*
